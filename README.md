### IBM Professional Data Science Project.  
For the final project of the IBM Professional Data Science Course on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).  
The task for this Capstone project is described as follows:  
  
  
>>This capstone project course will give you a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data. 

>>You will learn about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. You will learn how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. You will also learn how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. You will utilize Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which will help you refine your skills for exploring and analyzing data. 

>>Finally, you will be required to use the Folium library to great maps of geospatial data and to communicate your results and findings.    
  
  The task I came up with is some very basic comparison between east and west germany, each represented by two cities.  
  A more detailed description can be read in the Introduction template, provided in this repository.
